## Github user fetcher app
This app simply retrieves a GitHub user based on a given username and displays its avatar and followers on GitHub. It's made for a demonstration of [Expo Router's API Routes](https://docs.expo.dev/router/reference/api-routes)

### Requirements
To use Expo, you need to have the following tools installed on your machine:

- [Node.js LTS release](https://nodejs.org/en) - Only Node.js LTS releases (even-numbered) are recommended.
As Node.js officially states, "Production applications should only use Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases". You can install Node.js using a version management tool (such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [volta](https://volta.sh) or any other of your choice) to switch between different Node.js versions. I personally like Volta
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) for source control.
- [Watchman](https://github.com/facebook/watchman) (for Linux or macOS users).

For further instructions, check [Expo's installation page](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation)
